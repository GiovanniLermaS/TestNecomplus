# TestNecomplus

This test is done with MVVM architecture, Hilt dependency injection, View Binding, Retrofit, and Glide. 

It is successfully done showing the list of top artists with a limit of 10 and that by clicking on any item on the list it is possible to see their top tracks with a limit of 5. Being of this I found that the images do not show anything.

This architecture is used due to the great ease that it gives me to do it with everything mentioned before, it allows me to have an organization and division of logic with the view, I feel that it is simple with the dependency injection that I use and it does not require a lot of logic or code to be built.

In accordance with good development practices, I feel that there are several important things such as knowing the scope of the project, requirements that are requested, not inventing code, commenting on the code and facilitating maintenance, thus having scalability.
